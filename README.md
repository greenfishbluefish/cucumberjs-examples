# Cucumber.JS Examples

This is a set of examples that showcase how to use Cucumber.JS with different
browser managers.

## Prerequisites:

* Node.JS 4+
    * I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

## Commands

* `grunt example-phantom`
    * This runs the Cucumber features with the PhantomJS support.
